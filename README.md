# StateFairProject

This project will build an interface where the results of a Missour State Fair competition (a specific competition class, or division) can be selected and and the competition winner home city/county will be highlighted on a map of Missouri counties (a heat map) so that the user can see what areas of the state are contributing most winners to the fair in the different competitions.
